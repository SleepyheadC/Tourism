        <h2>
            Taj Mahal was built by a grief stricken Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial to his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal.
        </h2>

            A world-renowned wonder, Taj Mahal sits pretty on the northern side of this green paradise.

It looks the same from all the four sides. The Quranic inscriptions on its four entrances are carved in such subtle increase in size that may appear to be of the same size from top to bottom.

Shahjahan invited master craftsmen from as far as Italy and Persia to help design his ambitious tribute to love.

The Taj Mahal is phenomenal not in its beauty alone that shines forth, but in the deep planning and design that went into its making, and the ethereal idea of immortalizing love. Delicate carvings in marble vie with gorgeous pietra dura for attention.

Lapis-lazuli, Cornelian, Mother of pearl, Agate and Emerald are inlaid in floral and geometrical patterns in the marble itself.

Work on this enchanting mausoleum on the bank of Yamuna started in 1631 and it took around 22 years to complete the entire premises with the help of an estimated 20,000 workers.
