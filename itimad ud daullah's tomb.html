            This exquisite marble tomb was made by Emperor Jahangir's queen, Nur Jahan, in the memory of her father Mirza Ghias Beg during 1622-1628 A.D. Built entirely in white marble and inlaid with semi-precious stones, this mausoleum on the bank of the Yamuna exhibits a strong Persian influence.
